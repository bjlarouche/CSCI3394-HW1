#Q2. Birthday attack on a 40-bit hash (5 pt)

Write a program that returns a tuple (s, t, n), where 
s and t are different ASCII strings 
their SHA-1 hashes have the same high-order 40 bits (same 10 initial hex digits) 
n is the number of calls to SHA-1 

You can generate random ASCII strings by converting random integers to hex. By the theory of these birthday attacks, you will need to compute somewhat more than 1 million hashes to find this collision with probability greater than Â½. 

You need to do the following:
Upload your code to Github
Include the link to the code and TWO tuples (s,t,n) and their corresponding SHA-1 hashes in your solution. That is, you need to find TWO pairs of strings whose SHA-1 hashes are the same.

Hint:
To find the SHA-1 hash value of a string s, you can execute the following Python code:
import hashlib
hashval=hashlib.sha1(s).hexdigest()
